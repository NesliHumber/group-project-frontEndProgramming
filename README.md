## State Management

The application uses various state management techniques:

-   **`useState` Hook:**  Used in components like `PricingPage`, `TestimonialsPage`, and `FAQPage` for managing local component state, such as storing fetched data (`plans`, `testimonials`, `faqs`), handling loading states (`loading`), and managing errors (`error`).
-   **`useEffect` Hook:**  Works in conjunction with `useState` to handle side effects. Examples include fetching pricing plans in `PricingPage`, testimonials and success stories in `TestimonialsPage`, and FAQs in `FAQPage`.
-   **React Context API:**  Employed in the `HomePage / RoleSelector` to manage the global `selectedRole` state, making it accessible throughout the application. This allows role-based rendering and navigation based on the user's selected role.
-   **API Service (`/services/api.js`):** Centralizes data fetching.
